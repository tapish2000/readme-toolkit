# readme-toolkit
The readme-toolkit is a Python repository for generating a readme of a repository.

## Description
There is always a tension among the users for writing a flawless readme and it is also very cumbersome to do the documentation in the last moment.

 The project has been prepared keeping in mind these use cases:

1. For people who are new to `readme.md`
2. For people who write in the last moment
3. People with less vocabulary

 The highlights of the repositories are:

1. AST is used for finding out the most frequently used custom function
2. Dependency is listed for some supported languages
3. Neat framing of readme is provided as an output
